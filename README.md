# Guild Chat

Live Demo - https://www.guildchat.vantabbert.com
_(Caution: Messages are not able to be deleted, so please be mindful of what you type.)_

#### Dev Notes

Technology used - TypeScript. React v17, Firebase Real-time Database, React Router, Sass, Webpack/Babel, Jest/React Testing Library, ESLint/Prettier

Please have Node installed to run the application locally. Otherwise, you can view a live demo at the site shown above.

##### Setup/Installation

1. Clone or download the repo locally.
2. In top level of the application folder, install all packages with the command `npm i`.
3. To start the local development server/site, run the script `npm start`. This should open a browser to the url http://localhost:9000/. If it does not, you can open a browser to that url to see the running application.
4. Log in with a demo user to send messages to one of the other demo users.
5. To test 2-way communication, you can either open a second browser page and choose a different user. Or, partner with a dev friend and talk to one another!
6. One last reminder that there is no 'delete message' functionality, so be mindful of your messages. I will check in and wipe them periodically for safety/security reasons.
